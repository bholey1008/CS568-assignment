### Monitoring and Inspection:

- **Watch**: Allows you to monitor the value of variables as your code runs. (`Ctrl + Shift + W`)
- **Scope**: Shows the local variables (properties) within the current scope. (`Ctrl + Shift + S`)
- **Hover Over Code Line to See Error**: Hovering over a line of code displays any error messages associated with that line. (`Ctrl + Shift + E`)
- **Hover to See Value**: Hovering over a variable displays its current value. (`Ctrl + Shift + V`)
- **See Global Variables**: Provides access to global variables within your code. (`Ctrl + Shift + G`)

### Execution Control:

- **Step Over**: Allows you to move to the next line of code, skipping over functions. (`F8`)
- **Play**: Resumes execution of code after hitting a breakpoint. (`F5`)
- **Step Into**: Moves into a function call, allowing you to debug within that function. (`F7`)
- **Conditional Breakpoint**: Allows you to set breakpoints that will only pause execution when a specified condition is met. (`Ctrl + Shift + B`)

### Debugging Information:

- **Call Stack**: Displays the current execution stack, showing all the methods/functions that have been called. (`Ctrl + Shift + C`)
