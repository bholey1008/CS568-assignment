## Branch Management: 
*  **Create a new branch**
git checkout -b <new_branch_name>

* **Clone a specific branch**
git clone -b <branch_name> <repository_url>

* **Push to a branch**
git push origin <branch_name>
* Alternatively, if you're already on the branch you wish to push:
`git push origin`

* **Delete a branch locally**
git branch -d <branch_name>

* **Force delete a branch locally**
git branch -D <branch_name>

* **Switch to an existing branch**
git checkout <branch_name>

* **Pull updates from a remote branch**
git pull origin <your_branch>


## Merge changes from main branch into current branch(<Anjana_branch>)

### Working branch: <Anjana_branch>

* 1. **Switch to <Anjana_branch>**
git checkout <Anjana_branch>

* 2. **Pull changes from main branch**
git pull origin main

### Case 1:
* **If merge conflicts occur, undo the pull**
* 3a. Undo the pull
git reset --hard HEAD    * (or git merge --abort)

### Case 2:
* **After resolving conflicts, merge changes from main into your current branch**
* 4. **Merge changes from main into <Anjana_branch>**
git merge main

* After this, git will notify if conflicts need to be resolved. You will need to manually resolve them.
* Use your preferred code editor (e.g., VS Code) to manage conflicts.

* 5. **Commit the merge**
git commit -m "Merge main into <Anjana_branch>"

## How to Undo a Mistaken Commit in Git
-----------
### Scenario
You have made three commits, but the third commit (commit 3: HEAD) was a mistake. You need to revert to commit 2 and continue working from there.

### Method 1: Using `git revert`
**Purpose:** To undo the changes of a specific commit while preserving the integrity of the project history. Ideal for situations where the commits have been shared publicly.

**Steps:**
1. **Identify the Commit to Revert**
   - Use `git log` to view the commit history and confirm the commit hash or reference.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     git log --oneline
     ```

2. **Revert the Commit**
   - Execute `git revert` followed by the commit hash or `HEAD` (for the most recent commit).
   - Example:
     ```bash
     git revert HEAD
     git revert <commit_hash> (if you want to revert commit 2, then use that hash)
     ```
   - Git will automatically create a new commit that undoes the changes from commit 3.

3. **Review and Commit**
   - Git opens a text editor to enter a commit message for the revert. Save and close the editor to complete the revert.
   - The project history now includes a new commit that negates the changes made in commit 3.

### Method 2: Using `git reset`
**Purpose:** To completely remove the last commit, making the repository state as it was at commit 2. Best used for local changes that have not been pushed to a shared repository.

**Steps:**
1. **Perform a Hard Reset**
   - This will discard changes in commit 3 and reset your current branch's HEAD to commit 2.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     git reset --hard HEAD^
     ```

2. **Handle Remote Repositories**
   - If commit 3 was already pushed to a remote repository, and it's safe to rewrite history (e.g., no other collaborators are affected), use the following command to update the remote:
     ```bash
     git push origin <branch-name> --force
     ```
   - Caution is advised when force-pushing, as it can affect other collaborators.

### When to Use Each Method
- **Use `git revert`** when you want to preserve the history or if the commits have already been shared with others. Itâ€™s safe and keeps a record of what was undone.
- **Use `git reset`** for local cleanup before you've shared your changes with others, as it simplifies history but at the risk of losing changes.


## Working and merge with main branch 
(main ma bhayeko change anjana branch ma laune ani locally anjana ma main merge garne)
1. **Create and switch to the Anjana branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b Anjana
   ```

2. **Pull the latest changes from the remote Anjana branch:**
   ```bash
   git pull origin Anjana
   ```

3. **Work on the Anjana branch:**
   - Make your changes

4. **If anyone is working with the main branch:**
   ```bash
   4.1 ` Switch to the main branch`
   git checkout main
   
   4.2. `Pull the latest changes from the remote main branch`
   git pull origin main
   ```

5. **Switch back to the Anjana branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout Anjana
   ```

6. **Merge the changes from main into Anjana:** (main ma bhayeko change anjana branch ma laune ani locally anjana ma main merge garne, main branch ma kei effect hudaina. Anajana branch ma basera, main li merge garne)
   ```bash
   git merge main
   ```

7. **Push the merged changes to the remote Anjana branch:**
   ```bash
   git push origin Anjana
   ```

This sequence ensures you're working on the latest Anjana branch, incorporate changes from the main branch into your Anjana branch, and then push those changes to the remote Anjana branch.

# Case 1: Discard All Changes in the Working Directory
## Discard changes in tracked files
git checkout -- .

## Remove all untracked files and directories
git clean -fd

# 


Sure, I can help you with that. It sounds like you're working with Git and need to undo changes in two different scenarios: 

1. Discarding all changes in your working directory.
2. Removing changes from the staging area.

Here are the commands you'll need for each case:

### Case 1: Discard All Changes in the Working Directory
To discard all local changes in your working directory, you can use the following commands:

```bash
# Discard changes in tracked files
git checkout -- .

# Remove all untracked files and directories
git clean -fd
```

- `git checkout -- .` will revert all changes in tracked files.
- `git clean -fd` will remove all untracked files and directories. Use `-n` to see what would be removed without actually deleting anything.

### Case 2: Remove Changes from the Staging Area
If you have changes in the staging area that you want to remove, you can use the following commands:

```bash
# Unstage all changes
git reset
```

- `git reset` without any additional arguments will move all changes from the staging area back to the working directory.

If you have also committed the changes and want to undo the commit, you can use:

```bash
# Undo the last commit and keep changes in the working directory
git reset --soft HEAD~1
```

- `git reset --soft HEAD~1` will undo the last commit but keep the changes in your working directory.

If you want to undo the last commit and discard the changes:

```bash
# Undo the last commit and discard changes
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```

- `git reset --hard HEAD~1` will undo the last commit and discard the changes.

Be careful with `git reset --hard` as it will discard changes permanently.
-----------------------
### Discard Git Commit Operations

#### 1. Discard Local Changes (Not Yet Committed)

```
git checkout -- .
```
#### 2. Undo the Last Commit (Not Pushed Yet) || Remove changes and commit both
```
git reset --hard HEAD^
```
**This command removes the last commit along with all changes made in that commit. Be cautious as it permanently deletes changes.**

#### 3. Undo a Commit and Keep Changes (Remove commit only, but you can log that commit but that commit has no effect)
```
git reset HEAD^
```


4. Discard a Specific Commit (Already Pushed)
Soft Reset (Keep changes staged):

bash
Copy code
git reset --soft HEAD^
Mixed Reset (Keep changes unstaged):

bash
Copy code
git reset HEAD^
Hard Reset (Discard commit and changes irreversibly):

bash
Copy code
git reset --hard HEAD^
5. If Already Pushed and Shared with Others
Consider reverting the commit instead of rewriting history:

bash
Copy code
git revert <commit-hash>
Communicate with your team to handle the situation without disrupting collaborative efforts.

Additional Notes:
Always proceed with caution, especially with git reset --hard, as it permanently deletes changes.
Create a backup branch (git branch backup) before performing potentially destructive operations if unsure.
